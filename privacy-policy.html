								the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, as and when it comes into full effect.</p>
							<p>By accessing or using our Services, you signify your explicit consent to the collection, use,
								processing, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do
								not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services.</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
							<p>We collect various types of information to provide and improve our Services. This
								information can be broadly categorized as:</p>

							<h3>A. Information You Provide to Us (Directly Collected)</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, phone number, password, and profile picture. This is essential for identifying you and providing personalized services.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Payment Information:</strong> If you make payments through our Services, we collect payment method details (e.g., credit/debit card numbers, UPI IDs, bank account details) and transaction history. Please note that payment processing is often handled by secure third-party payment gateways, and we do not store full payment card details on our servers.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Demographic Information:</strong> We may collect information such as your age, gender, and preferred language to better understand our user base and tailor services.
								</li>
								<li>

								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Referral Information:</strong> If you participate in referral programs, we collect information about the referred individuals to track referral success.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Identity Verification & Driver/Captain Specific Information:</strong> For drivers/captains, we collect government-issued identification numbers (e.g., Aadhaar, PAN), driver's license details, vehicle registration information (make, model, license plate, insurance details), driving history, and other verification documents required for background checks, regulatory compliance, and ensuring safety on our platform. We also collect your bank account details for payout purposes.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Emergency Contact Information:</strong> You may choose to provide emergency contact details, which we may use to notify your designated contacts in case of an emergency during a trip.
								</li>

									<strong>Sensitive Personal Data or Information (SPDI):</strong> As defined under Indian law, this may include financial information (excluding payment card details not stored by us), biometric information (if collected for identity verification, e.g., facial recognition for driver login), and health information (if voluntarily provided for accessibility needs). We collect such data only with your explicit consent and for specific, lawful purposes.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>B. Information Collected Automatically Through Your Use of Our Services (Usage Data)</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Location Information:</strong> We collect precise or approximate location data from your mobile device when you use our Services, particularly for ride-hailing. This data is collected from the time a ride is requested until it ends, and sometimes when the app is running in the background if you have enabled this feature. This includes GPS, IP address, and Wi-Fi data, which are crucial for matching, navigation, and fare calculation.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Trip Information:</strong> We collect detailed information about your trips, including pick-up and drop-off locations, routes taken, distance travelled, duration of the trip, fare details, and any stops made. This data is vital for service delivery, billing, and dispute resolution.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with our Services, including access dates and times, features used, app crashes, and other system activity. This helps us understand user behaviour, diagnose issues, and improve our service.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect information about the devices you use to access our Services, including hardware models, operating system and version, software, unique device identifiers, mobile network information, and crash data. This assists in optimizing app performance and security.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit our website or use our app. This log data may include your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and the date and time of your requests.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>C. Information from Other Sources (Third-Party Data)</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> If you link, connect, or log in to your Go Payana account with a third-party service (e.g., social media platforms, payment providers), they may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service, subject to their privacy policies.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Background Check Providers:</strong> For drivers/captains, we receive information from background check providers and public records to verify identity, criminal history (where permissible by law), and ensure safety and compliance.

								<li>
									<strong>Insurance Providers:</strong> Information related to insurance claims or policies may be provided by third-party insurance partners in case of incidents.
								</li>

							<h2>3. How We Share and Disclose Your Information (Disclosure)</h2>
							<p>We may share and disclose your information with the following categories of recipients,
								always ensuring that such sharing is for legitimate purposes and in accordance with this
								Privacy Policy and applicable laws:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>With Other Users:</strong>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>Riders and Drivers:</strong> When a ride is requested and accepted, we share certain information between the rider and driver to facilitate the trip. This includes names, profile pictures, estimated pick-up/drop-off times, current location, and vehicle details (for riders). Drivers also see the rider's destination. This sharing is essential for the provision of the service.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Emergency Contacts:</strong> If you opt-in to our safety features, we may share your real-time trip details with your designated emergency contacts in case of an emergency.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We work with trusted third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing, background checks, data analysis, cloud hosting, customer service, marketing, IT services, and vehicle maintenance/inspection. These service providers have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose, adhering to strict confidentiality and security standards.

								<li>
									<strong>With Your Explicit Consent:</strong> We may share your information with third parties when we have obtained your explicit consent to do so for specific purposes.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Aggregated or Anonymized Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. This data is used for research, marketing, analytics, and other business purposes, such as analysing ride patterns, market demand, or service performance, without compromising individual privacy.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h2>4. Data Retention (Storage Limitation)</h2>
							<p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply
								with our legal obligations (e.g., tax, regulatory, and audit requirements), resolve disputes,
								and enforce our agreements. The retention period may vary depending on the type of
								information and the purpose for which it was collected. For example, trip history and
								payment transaction data may be retained for a longer period due to legal and financial
								requirements. Driver/captain verification documents are retained as long as they are active
								on the platform and for a period thereafter as required by law. When your information is no
								longer needed for these purposes, we will securely delete or anonymize it in a manner that
								prevents its reconstruction.</p>

						</div>

						<div>
							<h2>5. Data Security (Security Safeguards)</h2>
							<p>We implement robust technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your
								personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
								These measures include:</p>
							<ul>

								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
								Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
								information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You are responsible for keeping your
								account password confidential and for any activity that occurs under your account.</p>
