									<strong>Payment:</strong> You agree to pay all applicable fares, tolls, taxes (including GST), and other charges incurred in connection with your use of the Services. This includes any applicable cancellation fees, waiting charges, cleaning fees, or damage repair costs.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may be subject to a cancellation fee if you cancel a ride request after a Driver has accepted it and/or after a certain time has elapsed (typically 5 minutes for cabs, 2 minutes for auto-rickshaws, but subject to specific ride type policies). Cancellation policies will be clearly communicated within the app.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Safety and Conduct:</strong> You are responsible for your own safety and the safety of your belongings during a ride. You agree to follow the Driver's reasonable instructions, wear seatbelts, and not engage in any behaviour that could compromise safety or violate traffic laws. Do not distract the driver or interfere with the operation of the vehicle.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Damage to Property:</strong> You are responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, Driver vehicles and property resulting from your use of the Services in excess of normal "wear and tear." GoPayana reserves the right to charge you for such damages, and you agree to pay such charges.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Children and Minors:</strong> Children below 18 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Drivers are not permitted to transport unaccompanied minors.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Lost and Found:</strong> If you leave an item in a Driver's vehicle, GoPayana will assist in connecting you with the Driver. However, GoPayana is not responsible for lost or stolen items and does not guarantee their recovery. A retrieval fee may apply, payable directly to the Driver, for the return of lost items.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>No-Show Policy:</strong> If you are not present at the pickup location within the stipulated waiting time, the Driver may cancel the ride, and a cancellation fee may be applied.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Luggage Policy:</strong> Riders are permitted to carry reasonable luggage that can be safely accommodated within the vehicle's designated storage space (e.g., boot/trunk) without obstructing the driver's view or posing a safety hazard. Over-sized or excessive luggage that cannot be safely accommodated may be refused by the driver.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Pet Policy:</strong> Pets are generally not permitted in GoPayana vehicles unless the driver explicitly agrees or the vehicle type is specifically designated as "pet-friendly" within the app. Service animals (e.g., guide dogs) are an exception, subject to applicable laws. Riders must inform the driver in advance if they intend to travel with a service animal.
								</li>
							</ul>


							<h3>4.4. Driver Obligations (if applicable)</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Compliance:</strong> Drivers must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and licensing requirements related to providing transportation services in their jurisdiction, including but not limited to motor vehicle laws, traffic laws, RTO regulations, and local transportation regulations. This includes holding valid driving licenses, vehicle registrations, and insurance.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Ongoing Verification:</strong> Drivers agree to undergo periodic background checks, vehicle inspections, and document verifications as deemed necessary by GoPayana to ensure continued compliance and safety standards. Failure to comply with verification requests may lead to account suspension.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Vehicle Standards:</strong> Drivers are responsible for ensuring their vehicles are roadworthy, properly maintained, clean, and safe for passengers at all times. Vehicles must meet all safety standards and regulatory requirements specified by GoPayana and local authorities.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Professional Conduct:</strong> Drivers must maintain a professional demeanor, adhere to safety standards, drive safely and responsibly, and provide services efficiently and courteously. This includes refraining from discrimination, harassment, or any unprofessional behaviour towards riders. Drivers must be punctual, communicate effectively with riders regarding pickup and route, and maintain a high standard of service.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Acceptance of Rides:</strong> Drivers are expected to accept ride requests promptly and complete them efficiently, without undue delays or unauthorized detours. Drivers must also adhere to the routes suggested by the GoPayana app unless a rider explicitly requests a change and it is safe and legal to do so. Drivers must not refuse rides based on destination, payment method, or any discriminatory reason.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Ratings and Service Quality:</strong> Drivers acknowledge that their performance is subject to rider ratings and feedback. Consistently low ratings, repeated violations of GoPayana's service quality standards, or non-compliance with these Terms may lead to suspension or termination of access to the platform, and may also impact incentives.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Drug and Alcohol Policy:</strong> Drivers must not consume alcohol or drugs while providing services or before coming online. GoPayana has a strict zero-tolerance policy for drug and alcohol use by Drivers.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Data Usage by Drivers:</strong> Drivers agree to use rider data (name, contact information, pickup/drop-off locations) solely for the purpose of completing the requested ride and providing the Services. Drivers are strictly prohibited from using rider data for any personal, commercial, or unauthorized purposes, or from sharing it with any third party.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Cancellation Penalties for Drivers:</strong> Drivers may be subject to penalties, including financial deductions or temporary suspension, for frequent or unjustified cancellations of accepted rides, or for non-acceptance of rides, as per GoPayana's internal policies communicated to drivers.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Insurance:</strong> Drivers must maintain valid vehicle insurance, including third-party liability insurance, as required by law and GoPayana policies, and provide proof of such insurance upon request.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h2>5. Payments and Fares</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Fare Calculation:</strong> Fares for rides are calculated based on factors such as distance travelled, time taken, demand (dynamic/surge pricing), applicable tolls, taxes (e.g., GST, service tax), and other surcharges (e.g., parking fees, airport charges, waiting charges). The estimated fare will be displayed before you confirm your booking. The final fare may vary based on actual route, traffic conditions, waiting time, and any additional services requested.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Dynamic Pricing (Surge):</strong> Fares may increase during periods of high demand (e.g., peak hours, bad weather) to ensure ride availability. This "surge pricing" will be clearly communicated to the rider before booking confirmation. By confirming a ride during surge pricing, you agree to the increased fare.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Payment Methods:</strong> Payments can be made through various methods accepted by GoPayana, including credit/debit cards, UPI, net banking, digital wallets (e.g., Paytm, PhonePe), or cash (where applicable). You authorize GoPayana to charge your selected payment method for all applicable charges incurred.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Refunds:</strong> Fares paid are generally non-refundable. However, refunds may be issued at GoPayana's sole discretion in cases of service issues, billing errors, or other exceptional circumstances. Any disputes regarding fares or charges must be raised with GoPayana customer support within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 24-48 hours) of the ride completion, providing all relevant details and proof.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Driver Earnings and Taxes:</strong> Drivers will receive earnings for completed rides, less any applicable commission, platform fees, or taxes (including GST) as determined by GoPayana. Payouts will be processed as per the agreed schedule (e.g., daily, weekly) to the bank account linked to the Driver's account. Drivers are solely responsible for all applicable taxes on their earnings, and GoPayana may provide necessary tax-related information or deductions as required by Indian law. GoPayana reserves the right to adjust commission rates and fees with prior notice.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Promotions and Incentives:</strong> GoPayana may offer promotions, discounts, or loyalty programs to Riders and incentives or bonuses to Drivers based on performance, ride volume, or other criteria. These are subject to specific terms and conditions and may be modified or withdrawn at any time by GoPayana at its sole discretion.

						</div>

						<div>
